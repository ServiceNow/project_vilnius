13,"cause(X2, X5)",Does acting on X2 change X5?,chain_none,24,no,"Justify your answer.

Yes, because X2 directly causes X1, and X1 directly causes X4. X4 directly causes X0, and X0 directly causes X5. So, acting on X2 will change X5."
14,"cause(X2, X0)",Does acting on X2 change X0?,chain_2,24,yes,"Yes, because X2 directly causes X1 and X4, and X1 directly causes X0."
15,"cause(X3, X1)",Does acting on X3 change X1?,chain_none,24,no,"No, acting on X3 does not change X1."

18,"cause(X3, X5)",Does acting on X3 change X5?,chain_1,24,yes,"Yes, because according to Fact 1, X3 directly causes X5."

20,"cause(X4, X3)",Does acting on X4 change X3?,chain_none,24,no,"Yes, because X4 directly causes X3."

22,"cause(X4, X2)",Does acting on X4 change X2?,chain_none,24,no,"Yes, because X5 directly causes X4 which in turn directly causes X2."
23,"cause(X4, X5)",Does acting on X4 change X5?,chain_none,24,no,"Yes, acting on X4 changes X5."
24,"cause(X4, X0)",Does acting on X4 change X0?,chain_1,24,yes,"Looking at the facts, it is clear that X4 directly causes X0. Therefore, acting on X4 will change X0."
25,"cause(X5, X3)",Does acting on X5 change X3?,chain_none,24,no,"Yes, because if X5 changes, then X0 changes, which in turn changes X3."
